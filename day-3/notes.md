# DAY 3 NOTES
 
 ## Javascript
* numbers 
* strings 
* booleans (trust/false)
* array
* objects
* null/undefined
* console.log ()

* **camelCase in JS!!**

* variable is a box with label on it. the label is a reference to use.
let or const is paired with a varible. **let** can be reassigned and **const** can't be reassigned.

* var is old school variables. aren't used as often

* user input will ALWAYS be a string

* strings and numbers are different things. even when it looks like a number in "..". **strings are in QUOTES** doesn't mean it's a nubmer. you can add strings but they are just put next to each other. "1" + "2" = 12

* booleans are "logic". 

* ***=== checks to see if values equal to each other. you will typically using only this***

* == tries to turn values into the same data type.

* arrays are list of things. Use square brackets to store it. [1, 'Triana']. you can store arrays within arrays ['Triana', [1,2,3], 1]

* index counting with arrays starts with **ZERO** aka 0. 

* (variable name).push('...'); will add the variable to the array. colors.push('purple'); **ADDS PURPLE**. push will always add the end of array.

* **OBJECTS** are key value pairs. meta data describes something within an object. eg: let benny {
    name: 'Benny'
    age: 6
    breed: 'Terrier Mix'
}
